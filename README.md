In this repo I will transition from old to new.

I started the repo by uploading old code, very close to the original version of 1997.

Note that I already have new versions of the app  - with less features - but with better looking graphics and also for other compilers, including fpc.
the fpc version will be in another repo.

## I jumped!

I have just taken an aggressive step by including a VCL version of the button frame, which is great for touch screen.

> But original code is still present - in Branch RG19ABC.

Now, suddenly, I have very new code and very old code in the same project.

- I am in the middle of transition.
- You can watch me as I go.
- Trying to reconcile old with new.
- Want to rescue some features, which did not make it into the published version.
- This repo will continue to use GDI for drawing, and have no dependencies.
- Old code not even tested on high-dpi screen.
- The master branch is work in progress.
