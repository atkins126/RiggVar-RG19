I started this repo by uploading old code, very close to the original version of 1997.

I did so while I already had newer versions of the app  - with less features - but with better graphics and using other compilers.
- FMX version is in repository RiggVar-RG38
- LCL version is currently in a private repository.

The goal is to keep this repo very close in functionality to both the FMX and LCL versions.

> This is the VCL version.

It still contains GDI drawing code.

Note that there are two permanent branches.

## Branch RG68

This branch may end up being - or continue to be - the feature richest app, for the desktop, with main menu and status bar.

## Branch RG19ABC

- RG19A is an MDI application (oldest)
- RG19B is an SDI application (old)
- RG19C is better than RG19B, in my opinion.
