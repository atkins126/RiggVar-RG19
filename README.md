I started this repo by uploading old code, very close to the original version of 1997.

I did so while I already had newer versions of the app  - with less features - but with better graphics and for other compilers.
- FMX version is in repository RiggVar-RG38
- FPC version is currently in a private repository.

The goal is to make this rep be very close in functionality to both the FMX and FPC versions.

> This is the VCL version.

It still contains GDI drawing code, no GR32 here.

Note the two branches which contain older code, with features not surfaced in newer versions.

## Branchpoint RG68

This branch may end up being - or continue to be - the feature richest app, for the desktop with main menu and status bar.

To be done: Reconciliation of old and new code.

## Branchpoint RG19ABC

- RG19A is an MDI application (oldest)
- RG19B is an SDI application (old)
- RG19C has an slightly updated UI but still without the button frame.
